// get all the HTML down, 
// dont worry about things lining up exaclty, 
// get the skeleton down of all sections, 
// then we can begin to style the sections. 
// 

// main project section, 
// container for all items, 
// each item will have a card, 
// link to the selected project, a preview/snapshot of the site, 
// within the card is a title, p tags, and icons for links to the selected sites, 
// 

// footer section, 
// card with title/header, a few p tags, and img, 

// the goal should be to get the picture to line up at the footer, 
// mostly get all the HTML and structure of the site down for the most part, 
// try to get the img in the footer to line up with the text, just like the example, 

// OK I now have the footer img right next to the footer text content 
// I more or less have all the html content, 
// before moving on and styling the header section first, 
// add another container with logos of technologies used, 
// download icons/logos for 
// JS, HTML, CSS, SASS, REACT, JEST, GIT, GITHUB, NPM
// 
// under my projects, make a flex container and add img tags 
// which will include icons for various technologies. 

// I can begin to style the header section, 
// first I can select a background color, and fonts that I would want to use, 
// lets first start with background color. 
// I like a half white and purple background, cut in halves. Figure out how to implement that 
// color scheme for the header. 

// header section is coming along, 
// choose a better font, play around with the fonts, 

// header
// select and play around with fonts, 
// get the header img responsive, should look good and adapy on smaller screens 
// before moving forward 

// make the header img responsive, 
// try to crop a smaller img and use that, see if you can use the design from last night

// why when I use the picture tags, it significantly reduces the img size? Yet I'm setting a base width and I inspect in dev tools the width is still
// 20% ??? 

// How can I get a smaller version of the same img? How can I edit it so I can use a smaller img at a different screen size, 
// 

// header responsiveness is good for now, 
// move onto styling the main, and my skills sections 

// for the my skills section 
// I have the flex wrap down when the screen shrinks 
// try now to put a little description text underneath each icon 
// just so the person knows the name of the technology. 


// still working on responsive header img, 
// I will try to copy what or did with his pic 
// looks he set an img container. to a certain width and calc for a height. 
// then on the img itself 

// begin to work on my projects section, 
// see how you can add a screenshot of a project, and do that for each project listed, 
// see if you can screenshot weather app, or todo list
// and then insert that screenshot into an img tag and style it 

// add the last site preview for project 6 
// begin to add the basic styling, such as centering items 
// center items 
// increase font size 

// for the header I would like to edit a few things, 
// follow or's format in having the header, description on left, 
// and the picture on the right, 
// will probably have to use a flex container, to make it work 
// switch the layout to column when screen size goes to certain width, 

// look at the html, 
// how can I get header text on the left, and picture on the right, 
// then use media query to change the layout to column 
// when screen size shrinks. 

// you will need two different containers, 
// one with flex properties that is in a row, 
// the other with column as flex direction, 

// I actually like the old header better, 
// I reverted back to it, now I will apply a little more styling to the main section, 
// considering different widths or padding and margin, to make it somewhat responsive, 
// the focus now is on the projects section making sure it shrinks and sizes properly. 

// main project is good enough for now, 

// work on styling up the footer section a little better, 

// make footer text responsive just like header text, 


// see next that you can change the git and linkin icons in the footer, to white, 
// then make sure to make functional links, 
// link to repo and link to live site 

// choose a different icon for livelink for each project 
// different fonts 
// a button in the header, that scrolls down to projects section, 

// get rid of background in profile pic,  

// clean up certain areas, 
// get links working for projects, fix the about me/background 

// make the projects btn work, 
// once clicked it will scroll down to projects section, 
// change the fonts, 
// make the links/btns work for the projects 
// make links work for header/footer btns, 
// change icon/img for link in the projects card, 

// my projects header btn is working 
// next get the links in the header working too, try to use onclick,
