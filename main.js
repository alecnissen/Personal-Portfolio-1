// get all the HTML down, 
// dont worry about things lining up exaclty, 
// get the skeleton down of all sections, 
// then we can begin to style the sections. 
// 

// main project section, 
// container for all items, 
// each item will have a card, 
// link to the selected project, a preview/snapshot of the site, 
// within the card is a title, p tags, and icons for links to the selected sites, 
// 

// footer section, 
// card with title/header, a few p tags, and img, 

// the goal should be to get the picture to line up at the footer, 
// mostly get all the HTML and structure of the site down for the most part, 
// try to get the img in the footer to line up with the text, just like the example, 

// OK I now have the footer img right next to the footer text content 
// I more or less have all the html content, 
// before moving on and styling the header section first, 
// add another container with logos of technologies used, 
// download icons/logos for 
// JS, HTML, CSS, SASS, REACT, JEST, GIT, GITHUB, NPM
// 
// under my projects, make a flex container and add img tags 
// which will include icons for various technologies.
